Comments on the specification:

* The [Unicode] reference needs to be a normative reference.  In
  section 4.2.3.2 there is a MUST requirement to reject strings that
  begin with combining mark/character.  The exact definition of what a
  combining mark/character is only given in [Unicode].

  Strictly speaking, without a normative and stable definition of what
  a combining mark/character is it is not possible to implement
  IDNA2008.

* The [Unicode-UAX15] reference is not to a stable document, the link
  goes to a living document that is actively modified.

  Strictly speaking, without a normative and stable definition of the
  NFC algorithm it is not possible to implement IDNA2008.

* Section 5.5 of RFC 5891 is performed on A-labels too, causing double
  ACE encoding.
