Libidn2 is a free software implementation of IDNA2008.

* Version 0.5 (released 2011-05-18) [alpha]

** Fix NFC check to compare entire strings.
Some non-NFC strings were permitted when they should have been
rejected.  Reported by Robert Scheck <robert@fedoraproject.org>.

** Self tests are not run under valgrind by default anymore.
Use --enable-valgrind-tests if you want to run self tests under
valgrind.  The reason was that there were too many false positives on
some platforms with valgrind issues in system libraries.  Self tests
are still run under valgrind by default when building from version
controlled sources.

** API and ABI is backwards compatible with the previous version.
