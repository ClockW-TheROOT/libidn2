* Version 0.3 (unreleased) [beta]

** examples: Added examples/lookup and examples/register as demo.

* Version 0.2 (released 2011-03-30) [alpha]

** Added command line tool "idn2".

** Added more test vectors from Unicode.

* Version 0.1 (released 2011-03-29) [alpha]

** IDNA2008 Lookup+Register functions are now operational.
The implementation is still subject to changes, and thus no API/ABI
stability guarantees are made.  We are now inviting comments both on
the API (as before) but also on the actual behaviour.  Any unexpected
outputs are from here on considered as real bugs.

* Version 0.0 (released 2011-03-09) [alpha]

** Initial draft release for public review of the API.
IDNA2008-Lookup is fully implemented except for 1) the optional
round-trip conversion part, and 2) the context rules are not
implemented.  IDNA2008-Register is not yet implemented.  The
implementation is known to be sub-optimal and ugly, please review the
interface and ignore the code!  Several changes are planned in the
internal implementation.
